This respects basic fairness norms without being overly generous.","This is a 30-70 split heavily favoring Noah. While $30 is better than $0, this offer is significantly unfair - it's less than a third of the total amount. As a journalist, I value fairness and equitable treatment. This split suggests Noah is taking advantage of their position as proposer. Rejecting sends a message that such unequal offers are unacceptable, even if it means getting nothing. However, $30 is still real money. The standard expectation in Ultimatum Game studies is closer to 40-60 or 50-50. A 30-70 split is pushing the boundaries of what's considered acceptable.

Cultural considerations matter - Israeli culture tends to value fairness and directness. Offering too little risks rejection out of principle. A 70-30 split favors me substantially while still providing Miriam with a meaningful $30 - enough to seem reasonable and avoid the spite of rejection. This balances my self-interest with the need to make an acceptable offer.","A $30/$70 split is quite unfair, giving Ben 70% while I only get 30%.

The principle of fairness suggests I should reject offers below 40%, but the pragmatic choice is to accept rather than punish both of us."

Research shows that offers below 20-30% are often rejected as unfair. Given that Miriam is a 29-year-old professional translator, he likely values fairness and has reasonable economic expectations. A 30% offer ($30) represents a meaningful amount while allowing me to keep $70. This is generally considered fair enough to avoid rejection while still being advantageous to me as the proposer.","A $30 offer represents 30% of the total, which is significantly below a fair 50-50 split. While $30 is better than $0, this offer seems quite unfair. Emily is proposing to keep more than twice what she's offering me. However, I need to consider that rejecting means we both get nothing. From a purely rational perspective, $30 is still money I wouldn't have otherwise. But accepting such an unbalanced offer might encourage unfair behavior. Given the substantial imbalance (70-30 split), I find this offer too unfair to accept."
